# Challenges Faced During Experimenting
- Faced confusion while setting up the local server (had to learn how to use the Python server command).
- Had difficulty understanding and organizing the game folder structure.
- Encountered issues adjusting the canvas size and screen resolution.
- Needed multiple trial-and-error attempts to fine-tune the jump physics values.
- Enemy and bullet collision detection was not working correctly at first.
- The player sometimes got stuck on platform edges due to collision glitches.
- Had trouble implementing the C key as a single-shot shooting input.
- Gravity felt too strong initially and required balancing adjustments.
- Due to browser cache issues, game updates were not reflecting immediately.
- Faced a few syntax errors in game.js (missing commas, brackets, etc.) that needed debugging.
